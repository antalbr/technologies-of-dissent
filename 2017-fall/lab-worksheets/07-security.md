2. Verify your IP address using `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/*nix).
   Verify your IP using Google (type `my ip` in the search bar). Note your IP
addresses here.

3. Browse the internet using Tor browser (visit some common sites, including
   Columbia). Try to watching a Youtube video.

4. Repeat #2 while using Tor Browser. Note your IP addresses here.

5. In your own words explain the difference in IP addresses above.

6. Create VPN connection to Columbia university from a site outside of the
   Columbia network.

7. Compare your IP addresses with and without VPN and discuss the difference.

8. Find a case study (an organization, group, or people) who use Tor or
   recommend Tor for specific *civic* purposes. Who are they? What do they do?
And how do they use Tor?

## For an extra challenge

9. Connect too google.com using the Tor Browser. Use `traceroute` to verify
   the same path to google. TOR does not seem to be working. Why?

10. Route your web traffic through an SSH connection to Columbia. Post
